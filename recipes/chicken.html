                    <ul>
                        <li>2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
                        <li>3 tablespoons spicy seasoning mix</li>
                        <li>a few tablespoons of olive oil</li>
                        <li>3 sweet potatoes</li>
                        <li>5-6 cups of broccoli florets</li>
                        <li>coarse sea salt and freshly cracked pepper</li>
                        <li>avocado/hummus/lemon juice/chives/olive oil for serving</li>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Toss the chicken pieces with the spices and a quick stream of olive oil. Stir to combine; store in the fridge for about 30 minutes while you prep other ingredients.</li>
                        <li>Arrange the vegetables on their own sheet pans (preferably ones with edges to catch drips, etc.). Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt. Arrange the chicken on a separate sheet pan.</li>
                        <li>Bake all ingredients for 12-15 minutes. Remove the broccoli and chicken. Stir sweet potatoes and roast another 15 minutes or so.</li>
                        <li>Done! Divide your servings out into containers and be happy you have meal starters ready for the week!</li>
                    </ol>
